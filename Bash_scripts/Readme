# Batch assembly scripts
The following documents are an embedded custom Bash shell script containing the steps used to generate the assemblies for the isolates 
sequencing data. All scripts contain hardcoded paths and data specific naming conventions and should therefore only serve as examples. 
The first script autogenerates a configuration file for the A5 assembler, then takes the forward and reverse sequencing files for an isolate and assembles them. 
The second script runs SSPACE one the newly made assembly and uses the read data to extent contigs into bigger scaffolds based on the knowledge of 
paired end reads being ~350 bp apart from each other. The third script employs Gapfiller to resolve ambiguous base calls by trying to map reads to 
these regions that have minimal overhang with unambiguous base calls.
